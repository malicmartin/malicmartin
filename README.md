## About Me

Hello! I'm Martin, a determined individual navigating a transformative journey into the tech industry. Originally from Slovenia, I studied law at the University of Ljubljana. However, a year before graduation, I experienced second thoughts about my direction.

I've been wanting to live abroad for a long time, so I've decided to turn a fresh page and move to London where I've tried a few different careers before coming to the conclusion that I want to be in tech.

## My Journey

- **Education**: I pursued law studies at the University of Ljubljana.
- **Career Transition**: From delivering pizzas for Domino's to excelling as a sales negotiator at a prominent London estate agency, I cultivated resilience and adaptability.
- **Entrepreneurial Pursuit**: With foresight of economic shifts, I embarked on a journey to acquire an estate agency, seeking opportunities for entrepreneurship and high-risk, high-reward ventures through the creation of significant value-added output. Despite relentless efforts, my quest remained elusive.
- **Tech Aspiration**: Faced with the reality of a shifting landscape, I decided to acquire in-demand skills with limitless potential. Python became my entry into a new industry, initially learned through a Cisco Networking Academy sponsored course and further honed through a DfE-funded skills bootcamp by HyperionDev.

## Projects

- : Another work in progress is Baldur's Gate 3 tactics analyzer - a program designed to calculate the expected statistical outcomes of different tactics in Baldur's Gate 3. Its purpose is to assist the player in making the best tactical decisions during battles.
